        <li>I leared how I should focus on what information is presented
            and what information is potentially hidden from the user. I 
            should also pay attention to what the website/app is meant to do
            and what kind o audience it is targeting.
        </li>
        <li>My favorite part of the article is how it gave an example of 
            an app or a website and pointed out what was specific about it that
            guides the user to think about something. For example, in one of 
            the apps, the search bar didn't plainly say "search" but instead 
            mentioned a specific city that could potentially excited the user.
