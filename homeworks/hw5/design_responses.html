                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned that hovering transitinos are really important in making a website feel interactive. The pace of these transitions seem to matter a lot too. It seems like that using colors that are softer on the eyes is really important. </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I really like how there ar a variety of different apps and websites that highlight similar good things when designing. It really shows how there are many ways to design websites but there are similar concepts that overarch all of them. For example, simplicity seems really important and making sure things aren't too crowded. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I really liked the easygro.io app. I thought it was really nice how for each ingredient, the entire page shifted in color. The color tones were also really pastel and soft on the eyes. When swiping between ingredients, not all the elements shifted at the same time, creating a cool, unique effect that caught my eye. Lastly, I really liked how it was really simple and it wasn't too crowded. </p>
