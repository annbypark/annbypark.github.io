					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I didn't know companies follow certain padding rules like making sure every design element
								is a multiple of 8 pixels. Thinking back on it, it makes sense because it gives a sense of uniformity
								and everything will seem more consistent in the long run. As stated in the article, it also gives a 
								sense of intentionality to the use of white space. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was how they mentioned some common myths or misconceptions that
								people often make about white space and addressed whether they were right or wrong. Particularly,
								I found it interesting how the article disagreed with th efact that white space will make users not
								see all the content because white space takes up space. They stated that the white space actually
								captures the user's attention and makes them want to scroll more. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "When in doubt, add more white space" </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>

							<p> 8! </p>
